# Money-Manager App!

This app is an attempt to make something simple to manage money online. With the current release of the app has the ability to store payments made by user or shared with user (*split bill among friends*).


# How to start the app?

This app is a MERN stack application where MERN stack stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Follow the steps below after cloning the project from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/prakharsaxena1/Money-Manager)  to start and use the app.

1.  First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download it from [here ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2.  Once you have those two things installed, navigate to the root directory of the app in your terminal. You will see folders "client" and "server".
3.  One by one navigate to both the directories and run the command `npm install` in each directory to install all of the necessary dependencies for the app.
4.  Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the app by running the command `npm start`. Again this has to be done in both the directories.
5. The server will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and client will run on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/).

# How to use the app?
Once the app is running you will be directed to the login page. I have setup some accounts for you with some dummy transactions to use. Or if you decide to make another account then click on register page and make one. However, in the new accounts registered by user, the friends functionality is not available as the app is still in development. Till then play with the app with the following accounts and passwords, these are names based on my friends and my gaming aliases.
